## 📖 About the Project
**Via-Health** is a React-based web application created as part of my **Economy Project** 💼.  
It focuses on **healthcare at home** 🏥, allowing users to track, visualize, and manage medical-related data easily.  

This is just the **frontend version** for now ⚡, and I'm actively looking to **develop it further** with a backend, more features, and better UX/UI 🎨.

## ✨ Features
- 📝 **Data Tracking:** Log medical/home health data easily  
- 📊 **Visualizations:** See charts/stats of your health info  
- ⚡ **Fast & Responsive:** Built with React for smooth performance  
- 🎯 **Scalable:** Designed to expand with backend and more advanced features
